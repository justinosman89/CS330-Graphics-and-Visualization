# CS330-Graphics-and-Visualization
How do I approach designing software?
I start with understanding user requirements, then move to sketching out a high-level architecture, breaking down the system into manageable components, and finally mapping out the user experience flow. Throughout this process, I prioritize functionality, scalability, and user-centric design.

What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
This project honed my skills in 3D spatial awareness and texture application, teaching me to create more realistic environments. It also improved my ability to conceptualize and execute complex visualizations that are both aesthetically pleasing and functionally sound.

What design process did you follow for your project work?
I followed an iterative design process starting with a basic prototype, incorporating feedback, and refining the design in cycles. This helped to gradually build up complexity and ensure each component interacted with the others as intended.

How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?
The iterative design approach and emphasis on modularity from this project can be applied to future work to develop robust and flexible software solutions. This method ensures continuous improvement and adaptability to user needs.

How do I approach developing programs?
I approach program development methodically: first defining the problem, then planning the logic with pseudocode or flowcharts, coding with regular testing, and finally refining through debugging. I also keep scalability and maintenance in mind from the start.

What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
I incorporated modular development and object-oriented strategies to handle the complexities of 3D scenes, allowing for more organized and reusable code. I also used shader programming to enhance the realism of materials in the scene.

How did iteration factor into your development?
Iteration was key; each component was developed, tested, and refined repeatedly. This allowed for steady progress and the ability to integrate enhancements or correct issues as they arose, rather than only at the end.

How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the project’s completion?
My approach evolved to become more agile, learning to adapt quickly to new requirements and feedback. I began to write cleaner, more organized code, and started using version control systems more effectively to manage changes.

How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
Computer science provides a foundation of problem-solving skills, technical know-how, and systematic thinking that are valuable in any field. It equips me with the tools to create innovative solutions and to adapt to the rapidly changing technological landscape.

How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?
Computational graphics and visualizations have taught me the importance of data representation and the power of visual communication. These skills are transferable across various domains in education, from research to teaching methodologies.

How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?
These skills enable me to create engaging presentations, model complex systems, and provide intuitive interfaces for user interaction in professional settings. They’re particularly applicable in fields like UI/UX design, game development, and virtual reality.
